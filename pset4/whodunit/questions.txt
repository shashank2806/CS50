1.  The C99 standard includes definitions of several new integer types to enhance the portability of programs.
    <stdint.h> contains new unsigned type like uintN_t, intN_t where N represents no of bits and N=8,16,32,64.

2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are used in program to increase it's portability. The basic integer
    type were deemed insufficient to store data across diffrent platforms because of their diffrent size on 
    diffrent platforms. So these new data types used so that they have same size over diffrent platforms.

3.  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 byte
    LONG = 4 byte
    WORD = 2 byte

4.  Magic numbers for BMP file is 0x424d.

5.  bfSize : The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize : The number of bytes required by the structure. The structure is the struct BITMAPINFOHEADER.

6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  biBitCount

8.  fopen may return NULL in line 24 and 32 if it could not open infile or can't create outfile.

9.  Third argument always have 1 in fread because it reads the file 1 time.
    
10. 3

11. fseek moves file pointer position to given location, which is the refrence point for offset.

12. SEEK_CUR â€“ It moves file pointer position to given location.
